# MVVM
Architectural Patterns

Platform : Xcode 10 
Language : Swift 4.2

Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) is a software architectural pattern. MVVM facilitates a separation of 
development of the graphical user interface – be it via a markup language 
or GUI code – from development of the business logic or back-end logic (the data model).

Advantages: 

1.Maintainability 

2.Better Separation of Concerns 

3.Improved Testability 

4.Transparent Communication

Disadvantages:
1. Some people think that for simple UIs, MVVM can be overkill.
2. Similarly in bigger cases, it can be hard to design the ViewModel.
3. Debugging would be bit difficult when we have complex data bindings.
